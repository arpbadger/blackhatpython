# blackhatpython
A test repo for the book Black Hat Python as well as personal adaptations of ideas from the book. I will log my work here as I make my way through the book. Occasionally I will stray away from the code in the book to expand upon some ideas, create GUI applications from command line ones, or combine several tools into one.


## Chapter 1
1) tcp and udp clients
2) tcp server
